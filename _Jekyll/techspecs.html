<h3>Multi-stage filtering</h3>
<h5>Messages pass through multiple services prior to showing up in your inbox or quarantine.</h5>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12">
<p>
The overall Oikik system is divided into multiple stages that a message passes through prior to being
delivered to your inbox. If a message successfully navigates every stage of filters, it gets placed into
a delivery queue, and is sent along to your mail server immediately.
</p>
<p>
Each stage of filters assigns a score to the incoming message, and based upon the user's filter
sensitivity (set in the control panel at the individual or domain level), the cumulative score of the
message determines the action that the system takes for that message.
</p>
<p>
Messages get placed into one of three buckets: "definitely spam", messages that the system has
identified as absolutely a spam message, "possibly spam", messages that the system thinks might be spam
but isn't absolutely sure, and "clean", messages that the system thinks aren't spam.

						<p> The border servers accept messages and perform initial filtering, including reputation filters, DNSBL queries, SPF checking, and recipient validation.

Messages from senders with extremely good reputations are able to bypass further filters and get immediately delivered, while messages from senders with extremely poor reputations get quarantined immediately. </p>

                  		<p>The core filtering servers process the primary message queue, and apply bayesian machine learning, content filtering, URIBL queries, and more.

After a message is processed in the core, we determine the next action for that message based upon the user's preferences. Clean messages move to the delivery system, while spam messages are added to the user's quarantine. </p>

                  		<p> Every message that passes through the Oikik system gets added to a learning queue, which processes and adds to the bayesian network.

Once the message is learned as either clean or spam, the contents of the message are discarded, so there is no record of any clean message content inside Oikik. </p>

                  		<p>  Oikik captures a large amount of log data about a message, without saving the contents of the message, and you can see this log data on the dashboard.
The visibility into your mail logs can help you debug issues with your own mail server and see exactly what happened to each message that came into Oikik.</p>
