<div class="h4 my-2">What is a Cloud Based Anti Spam Service?</div>

A cloud based anti spam service is an email filtering solution hosted in the cloud rather than consisting of an on-premises software installation or hardware device. As with most “software as a service” products, a hosted spam filtering service is available on demand, has minimal maintenance overheads and requires no capital investment.

<div class="h4 m-2">How Antispam Solutions Achieve Effective Filtering</div>

<p class="m-2">The reason why such a high percentage of spam emails avoid detection by standard email filters is because spammers are continuously devising new ways to penetrate email security mechanisms. Due to the increasing sophistication of spam, antispam solutions have a dynamic approach to email filtering that incorporates the most effective filtering techniques. These include:</p>

<ul class="list-group m-2 p-2">
    <li class="list-group-item">Domain Name Server Blackhole Lists (DNSBLs) compare the IP addresses of inbound emails against those of known and suspected sources of spam, and reject, quarantine, or flag any that originate from an IP address with a poor reputation.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">Sender Policy Frameworks prevent the delivery of “spoofed emails” by checking the domain names in the senders´ addresses to ensure they are legitimate. This is an excellent filtering technique to reduce phishing emails.</li>
    
    <li  class="list-group-item">Content Analysis Tools analyze the headings and content of each inbound email and allocate a “spam score”. They also “learn” from end users´ actions the likelihood of an email being spam, often using “Bayesian Analysis” techniques.</li>
    
    <li  class="list-group-item">Recipient Verification Protocols compare the recipient addresses of inbound emails to ensure they match a valid mailbox (i.e. j.doe@xyz.com, sales@xyz.com, etc.). Those that do not match a valid mailbox are rejected or quarantined.</li>
    
    <li  class="list-group-item">SMTP Controls perform a number of tests to authenticate the source of emails. These tests can include checking the originating email´s MX record, confirming qualified MAIL FROM commands, and looking for digital signatures (a good way of reducing “false positives”).</li>

</ul>

<div class="h4 my-2">How a Hosted Spam Filtering Service Works</div>

<div class="">
Connecting to a hosted spam filtering service takes just a few minutes and involves redirecting the mail exchange (MX) record to face the service provider´s filtering service. Thereafter, the filtering process is conducted in the cloud, software updates are undertaken by the service provider, and the only configuration required is to meet the business´s monitoring and reporting requirements.

Typically, a hosted spam filtering service integrates with business directories such as LDAP and Active Directory so that email filtering policies can be applied with the click of a mouse. Thereafter, new policies can be applied – or existing policies adjusted – via a web-based portal that manages the entire network and eliminates the need for per-device agents.

From the web-based portal, administrators can whitelist approved senders, apply “acceptable spam thresholds”, monitor real-time activity on the mail server, and schedule activity and quarantine reports. Administrators can also connect with their service providers via the web-based portal so a secure channel can be created for troubleshooting any issues with the hosted spam filtering service.
